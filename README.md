# Touch Grass

A cool app for introverts to go ourtside and touch grass.
This serves as the course project for CS 484

## MVP Functionality

As part of the MVP functionality, the following has been implemented:
- User checks in with their location asking the application to suggest activities for touching grass with the option to collaborate with nearby users.
    - Collect the location information from the browser and send to the backend for further processing
    - Query the Google Places API from the backend to get nearby landmarks as activity spots.
    - Design system prompts as templates for the LLM (Google Gemini).
    - Pass landmarks and current location to Google Gemini for retrieving an activity suggestion based on the user's past activities.
- Display activity information for the user in the form of steps needed to complete the activity. A sample workflow would look like: 
    - Go to the lakefront trail from Adler planetarium
    - Ask someone to take a picture of yourself with the skyline in view.
    - Upload the picture to the app for verification.
- Store details in the database as the userâ€™s past activities.
    - The activity completion is tracked and the final step (in our sample, the image upload) is sent to the backend for verification.
    - Verify activity completion with Google Gemini by uploading the image
