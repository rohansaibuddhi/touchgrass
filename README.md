## MVP Functionality

As part of the MVP functionality, the following has been implemented:

- User checks in with their location asking the application to suggest activities for touching grass with the option to collaborate with nearby users.
  - Collect the location information from the browser and send to the backend for further processing
  - ~~Query the Google Places API from the backend to get nearby landmarks as activity spots.~~ Use Google Gemini to suggest nearby landmarks as activity spots.
  - Design system prompts as templates for the LLM (Google Gemini).
  - Pass landmarks and current location to Google Gemini for retrieving an activity suggestion based on the user's past activities.
- Display activity information for the user in the form of steps needed to complete the activity. A sample workflow would look like:
  - Go to the lakefront trail from Adler planetarium
  - Ask someone to take a picture of yourself with the skyline in view.
  - Upload the picture to the app for verification.
- Store details in the database as the userâ€™s past activities.
  - The activity completion is tracked and the final step (in our sample, the image upload) is sent to the backend for verification.
  - Verify activity completion with Google Gemini by uploading the image

## Known Issues

All known issues are issues with respect to the final deliverable but they are not part of the MVP as promised:

- login is using test accounts
- user registration is not implemented
- CSS broken on Firefox (Tailwind)
